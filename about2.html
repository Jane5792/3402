		<h1>Building equity by design.</h1>
		<h2>I am Jack Newman, but you can just call me Jack.
			<br>
			<br>
		Originally hailing from Gilpin County I've been honing my skills in Information Science, business, economics, ethics, logic, and management.
			<br>
			<br>
		I strive to create elegant solutions that surprise and delight users, while keeping complex technical dependencies in mind for implementation, scalability, and developer sanity.
			<br>
			<br>
		I've worked with small, agile teams on skunkworks projects and larger development teams with product lifecycles spanning multiple years.
			<br>
			<br>
		Depending on the team, resources, and deliverables I've worn many hats and held many positions over the years like: Floor Manager, Fabricator, Metalworker, Product Manager, and even Specialist.
