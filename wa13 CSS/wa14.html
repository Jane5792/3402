    		<p>Before putting pen to paper or fingers to keyboard every author should consider what they are trying to communicate, who they are trying to convey meaning to, and what the author wants their audience take away into their own lives. All these considerations are greatly impacted by the means of communication, or “channel,” the author settles upon. So maybe the real question authors should consider are: Which channels are most likely to reach and engage their audience? Which have they already used and trust?</p>
        <p>IBy following this perspective it is possible for every author to resist the impulse to automatically use channels that are familiar to them rather than those that are preferred by their audience, for example this writing would be found in a journal. Its formal tone looks to appeal to peers reviewing it, communicating meaning to other experts, advancing knowledge within a community, and building the credibility of both myself as an author and my work to my audience. I could also write like this if I were considering a meeting.</p>
        <p>Featuring key points, such as time and cost resources. Are my participants motivated enough to attend? How can I fit my work into their schedule and draw them in? Which activities can I use to: engage, build and share purpose, while spreading learning and information? Does my work require rousing oratory to enrapture my audience, or is it better to imbue it with a solemn weight to press upon their minds?</p>
        <p>Maybe it is all about perception, and authors need to hedge their work against the media since it is their credibility and reputation carrying the public, which face does the media want you to adopt? Does it play well with your time and skills? Do you approve of how your work will be used to influence the public and advance agendas?  </p>
				<p>How does your message affect the medium? A Jupyter notebook might be serviceable with your peers, but be too “unprofessional” and “rough” for meetings or to involve the media. A Reveal deck could wow a boardroom with sleek minimalism and content but be to lengthy for a news segment, exactly like Vega visualizations are perfect for all three audiences so long as the accompanying commentary gives context to understand it or adds to the meaning it is trying to convey. So, in conclusion, what is my presentation saying to you and has it succeeded in reaching you? </p>
