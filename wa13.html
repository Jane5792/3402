        <span>the god... dog... Cryptocurrency? of ambiguity and paradox</span>
    </div>
  	<div class="content">
    		<p>Blockchains are all the buzz these days, usually as a buzzword to illustrate the forefront and unfathomable depth of some software or computer security measure, but the reality of this tool is oft glossed over. First allow me to dispel the ever-present murk of hype and condemnation: blockchains are cryptographic measures that state authenticity, lineage, age, and sometimes function. That is all they do since they are a string of letters, symbols, and numbers or a mixture of all three. Blockchains only get interesting when their accompanying decryption (and thus encryption) is used to associate them with something [1].</p>
        <p>In the case of Dogecoin, a cryptocurrency using its own blockchain “hash,” that associated value is as currency with blockchain attributes denoting transaction details (time, number of exchanges, etc.) so that it can be used in lieu of traditional sovereign currency. But that is not what Dogecoin was created for, this cryptocurrency was created as a commentary on the backing of sovereign currency. The creators made Dogecoin in the image of a Meme [2] with no cap on the number of Dogecoins that could be produced, illustrating how a currency capable of infinite inflation [3] could still have value due to belief in the backing force behind said currency. Which in this case is a joke and the criticism of fiat currencies and banking’s credit system. </p>
        <p>Which is incredibly interesting considering cryptocurrencies provide a plethora of applications that traditional sovereign currencies cannot provide namely: person to person transactions without the involvement of facilitating third parties anywhere connected to the internet, essentially removing banks, vendors, brokers, firms, etc. From transactions, making it possible to solve or improve upon many of the problems that plague currency transactions, laws, security, business processes, and much more if adopted as a fiat currency. </p>
        <p>Dogecoin illustrates that a that blockchains can make even a meme a viable fiat currency, which could ensure secure direct digital payments, without third parties as I mentioned previously, that would be secure from the technical and cybersecurity problems that plague traditional sovereign currency systems where governments and banks: manipulate or control transactions, mismanage, and improperly or mistakenly direct client funds. All of which are possible so long as the users of the cryptocurrency have enough trust in the guarantor of the cryptocurrency as a fiat money, since its value would be determined by the stability of the guarantor and the trust users have in it.  </p>
        <p>Which is not actually that farfetched since all paper money is fiat money, meaning that it only has value so long as people trust the guarantor (most likely the government’s treasury department in actuality) to uphold the commodity value the fiat money represents. The only difference is that cryptocurrencies can preclude governments from pressuring third parties to confiscate the money since it can be solely held by the owner, and cannot be inflated by the government because of the private keys. Indeed, cryptocurrencies are especially popular in Venezuela for precisely these reasons [4]. Freeing the economy from the cybersecurity incidents that perpetually affect the traditional financial institutions, precluding hostile actors from stealing personal information and funds from these third parties. Personal information that is commonly dispersed between these third parties, and retained as modes of verification. Potentially making blockchain currencies completely private, precluding most fraudulent transactions, and removing the possibility of the targeted daily attacks upon financial institutions since they are unnecessary.</p>  
				<p>Removing these middlemen also does more than remove a security and privacy threat, it also reduces the cost of transaction since people can transfer value directly between parties avoiding these fees while also enabling a different form of online revenue. The most prominent of which is microtransactions [5], I.e., the ability to make transfers of only a few cents (or even fractions of a cent) at a time. Replacing the need for advert-funded (and thus driven) content, where people can opt to pay for the amount of time they actually access the article, page, or service instead of paying for subscription services that are not tailored to the amount of time users use them. Drastically reducing the overhead users incur while transitioning online platforms from marketing users for ad revenue to users actively paying for content and services they enjoy or use [6], there is no way for traditional sovereign currency to support these microtransactions as only cryptocurrency provides a solution for these low-to-no fee transactions and metered or usage access to content (I.e., club content). </p>
