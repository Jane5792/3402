<h1 id="header">WA4, Commodifying Romance, 
	<br>

Trivializing Love in Modern Relationships </h1>

<p class="paragraph">
	On “The Bachelor” and “The Bachelorette” female and male contestants are placed in direct competition with one another as they try to “win” the affections of the season’s bachelor or bachelorette respectively, who is intentionally placed upon a pedestal by the showrunner as they depict them as the ideal partner. Rather than getting to know one another, these contestants mostly attack the competition’s character to undermine them or prop up whatever personality they’ve adopted for the cameras.  
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
	These shows are at their core unrealistic and can be damaging to viewers as it reinforces the unhealthy idea that women and men should view each other as “commodities” to be won or as adversaries that must be removed for a relationship to occur or progress. More than that the framing of the season’s bachelor or bachelorette reinforces the idea that relationships founded upon power imbalances are acceptable or are an appropriate foundation for romantic relationships. 
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
	This goes in the face of individualism, the foundation of our nation that everyone is equally valuable and desirable, these shows instead commodify the titular bachelor or bachelorette as the ultimate prize. A prize who has a movie-magic perfect way of living, and has control over who gets to be around them and judges the worth of contestants based upon some surface-level interactions. Patrick Tully, a psychotherapist viewed the effects of these shows as negative since, “viewers may internalize the idea that relationships depend upon one partner, and the satisfaction they derive from said relationship, over the other. Which is the dynamic of an unhealthy relationship, but is being showcased as a glamorous start in these shows.” 
</p>

<p class="paragraph">
	Evidencing that this dynamic is unhealthy is that less than three couples formed via the show are still in a relationship despite there being 30+ seasons of these shows (an abysmal 14% still being together), these couples are not happy nor are they healthy. Once they leave the artificial Hollywood “paradise” of the show they are shocked into reentering reality, “Contestants are asked to try out a relationship in an environment filled with novelty, mystery, and unprecedented glamour," Lindsay Jernigan clinical psychologist said. "Although couples testing out relationships on 'The Bachelor' certainly face stressors together, they are not the typical stressors that are pitfalls for most couples, such as financial strain, work stress, division of labor, and humdrum routine.

<p class="paragraph">
	In conclusion, shows like “The Bachelor” and “The Bachelorette” are profoundly unhealthy for their contestants and for their viewer base. Their inception, creation, and dissemination all trivialize normal relationships and normalize abusive behavior between partners all under the mask of romance and selling snake oil claiming to be the idealized form of partnership.
